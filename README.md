This repository contains the software, data and reproducibility instructions 
to produce the plots of the paper "Improved Bipartite Plots of Ecological Networks Using the k-core
Decomposition with the BipartGraph Application".
Please, clone the repo and follow these steps.

## Data

The input data folder contains the matrix interactions of six networks.

## Packages

You will have to install `bipartite` and `kcorebip`. For the latter, read the
installation instructions at
https://github.com/jgalgarra/kcorebip/blob/master/inst/doc/kcorebip_man.pdf

## Scripts

You will need R 4.3.0 or later. You have to run first `safariland.R`, and then
any other out of the six remaining scripts. Plots are stored in the `myimages`
folder.
